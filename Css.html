        <p> Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. Today, there are three cornerstone technologies of the World Wide Web, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>The <i>HyperText Markup Language</i> or <i>HTML</i> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

        </p>
        <p> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
            for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as "img" and "input" directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as "p"
            surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.</p>
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
            enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
            the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
        <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
            tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device</p>
        <p>CSS has various levels and profiles.</p>

                    the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules)[44] and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.</th>

                    for standardizing technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years</th>

            <tr>
                <th>CSS 3</th>
                <th>Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward
                    compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999</th>

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party
            libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
            and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
        <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally used
            only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
            the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
